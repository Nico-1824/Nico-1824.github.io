                    I am an aspiring Software Engineer and Machine Learning Architect. I am learning everyday how to expand the tools at my disposal. 
                    I am a 3rd year at San Diego State University learning the theory and fundamentals of computer science. However, I practice and 
                    push my abilites whenever I can. I contiously look for new projects to push myself or look into new frameworks, new tochnologies,
                    or an area I'm not comofortable with so that I can be versed in many fields.

                    This is one of my first webpages that I built to see if I was learning
                    HTML and CSS well enough to make something from scratch. It's very 
                    simple and is purely meant to illustrate that I have learned how to
                    use HTML and CSS effectively. The Javascript is also very simple
                    and simply checks for if the add button is pressed which brings up a 
                    modal to input a new item. Then it checks if the submit button is clicked 
                    to then add it to an array that will update the list box.

                    This project is a more recent project that I took on to exercise
                    my knowledge of React and practice using it to update pages, route
                    between pages, and have a more dynamic webpage. Additionally it 
                    revisits a past project I made in Flutter but this takes on a sort
                    of wepage version of that.
