                <p>
                  My name is Nicolas Brizuela, my goal is to be a software engineer working on innovative technology. My ideal career trajectory
                  would be to go into a Software Engineering position, move into Full Stack Development, progress into a Machine Learning Architect,
                  and then move into a leadership position such as team or project lead, after my vast years of experience. I am very ambitious and
                  love to build applications and systems from scratch so that I have full control over the control flow of the application. My goal
                  is to be a part of a team that is coming up with a new technology from zero and be able to be a part of the process to make a real
                  impact on the world from the ground up.

                <p>
                  While my experience in the field is professionally limited, this has not stopped me from trying my best to gain experience on my
                  own accord. I am a 3rd year college student at San Diego State University (SDSU) studying Computer Science. I consistently create
                  personal projects in my spare time while working a part-time job, and I am active in an App Development Club here at SDSU. Some of
                  my favorite projects I have built can be found on the <a href="/index.html">Projects Tab</a>, but personally hold the Random
                  Cooking App and Finance Tracker are up there as they were my first fully developed apps with a GUI that I could show off to someone
                  who isn't familiar with code. However, since these early projects, I've learned important Web Development skills from the club I
                  was involved in and personal knowledge seeking through online courses and projects to practice. I have built a number of webpages,
                  such as this one, which include a Pantry List, a Finance Tracker, and a Notes Summarizer that would allow you to input notes and
                  would spit out a summary for you to read.

              <h1>Refelction</h1>
              <p>
                One project I want to highlight from my resume is my Finance Tracker that I built with Flutter, because this project shows a lot of growth
               in my abilities. When starting this project in my second year of college, I knew the fundamentals of Python and Java very well. I knew
               how to work in both languages very well and could do what was asked of me for classes, but I hadn't worked with many frameworks before this.
               When I took this project as a challenge, I had to learn Flutter syntax, functions, how to render an app, how to update variables, how to test
               functions, and so much more to get this project to work. In a month's time I had watched hours of tutorials on Flutter and practiced
               within the confines of the project itself. However, I was able to build a prototype app that was functional and did what it was intended
               within strict parameters, but it worked. That was a massive achievement that I had been able to learn a new framework to be able to build something
               real, which made me hungrier to learn and advance my knowledge. An unexpected output from this was that I realized later, after abandoning the project
               due to school and other factors, was that it would be an introduction in a way to doing web development with HTML and CSS. I wanted to revisit
               the project later, but I wanted to find a more reproducible way that I could show off since I couldn't publish the app publicly. This led me to
               HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make webpages that essentially do the same thing as Flutter, but could be publicly accessible with platforms such
               as GitHub Pages, which hosts this very webpage. My assumptions about building apps in Java were that it would be more accessible since all of my
               college career, I had heard that most apps and websites we use today are built in Java, and that Java is multi-platform, so I assumed it would be
               readily able to move from the fundamentals to app development. I was horribly wrong, and while Flutter is not a complicated framework, it
               is essentially a new language within Java, and you need to learn the way it works and relates to Java to be able to use it. In the end, this was
               a great experience to have and showed me just how much I could learn and push myself while still coming out on top. This gave me a taste for
               what the field would look like, having to learn a new framework fast and having to be able to apply it on the go.
