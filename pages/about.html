                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Nicoals Brizuela, my goal is to be a software engineer working on inovative technology. My ideal career trajectory 
                    would be to go into a Software Engineering position, move into Full Stack Development, progress into a Machine Learning Architect, 
                    and then move into a leadership position such as team or project lead after my vast years of expierence. I am very ambitious and 
                    love to build applications and systems from scratch so that I have full control over the control flow of the application. My goal
                    is to be apart of a team that is coming up with a new technology from zero and be able to be apart of the process to make a real
                    impact on the world from the ground up.

                <h1>Previous Expierence</h1>
                <p>
                    While my expierence in the field is professionally limited, this has not stopped me from trying my best to gain expierence on my 
                    own accord. I am a 3rd year college student at San Diego State University (SDSU) studying Computer Science, I consistently create 
                    personal projects in my spare time while working a part-time job, and I am active in a App Development Club here at SDSU. Some of 
                    my favorite projects I have built can be found on the <a href="/index.html">Projects Tab</a> but personally hold the Random 
                    Cooking App and Finance Tracker up there as they were my first fully developed app with a GUI that I could show off to someone 
                    that isn't familar with code. However, since these early projects I've learned important Web Development skills from the club I 
                    was involved in and personal knowledge seeking through online courses and projects to practice. I have built a number of webpages, 
                    such as this one, which include a Pantry List, a Finance Tracker, and a Notes Summarizer that would allow you to input notes and 
                    woul spit out a summary for you to read.
