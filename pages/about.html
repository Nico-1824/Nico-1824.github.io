                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Nicoals Brizuela, my goal is to be a software engineer working on inovative technology. I have always been atracted to robotics and dealing 
                    with machines or IoT. When I was younger I was enrolled into a robotics club at my local atheletics club where we learned 
                    to build robots with legos and code software for them in visual block language. This was my first exposure to programming
                    and later was exposed to Raspberry Pi for Christmas. In my college education I have come to love the backend development of 
                    software and learning how to deal with APIs, servers, and handling requests and data from a database. Working on the behind
                    the scenes equipment is where I want to be and the opportunity to work and gain mentorship from a developer that works day 
                    in day out would be a privilage.

                    My expierence in the computer science field is very limited. I am a 3rd year college student at San Diego State studying computer
                    science, I make personal projects in my spare time while working a part-time job, and am active in a App Development Club here
                    at SDSU. Some of my favorite projects I have built can be found on the <a href="/index.html">Projects Tab</a> but personally hold the Random Cooking 
                    App and Finance Tracker up there as they were my first fully developed app with a GUI and executable files.
